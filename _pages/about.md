I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/) at Northwestern University, where I am advised by [Prof. Seyed Iravani](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~iravani/index.html) and [Prof. Ohad Perry](https://people.smu.edu/operry/homepage/). 

My research centers on the performance analysis, design, and control of stochastic systems through applying and developing tools in applied probability, queueing theory, Markov decision processes, ergodic theory, and optimization. A key focus of my work is understanding the value of ***redundancy***, ***flexibility***, and their ***interplay***---with both their limited ("a little") and full versions---in improving (or potentially harming) the efficiency of queueing networks. 
My work has broad relavance to a range of applications, including online service operations (e.g., cloud computing and storage systems, federal learning platforms), healthcare systems, supply chains, and most recently, the workflows of Large-Language-Model-based agents (see "Orchestrator-workers" in this [blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)). 

Prior to Northwestern, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Engineering Mechanics at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Leyuan Shi](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Shi_Leyuan/). In summer 2020, I worked as an operations reseracher intern in [Cardinal Operations](https://www.shanshu.ai).
